# NLP_Project
## Final Project
The objective of the final project is to apply what you have learned in this course to a
real world problem – a problem in your area of interest. You can apply any natural language
processing methods and models or softwares that we cover in the course. Below is a list of
websites that contain datasets and pretrained models that might be suitable for nlp projects.
Websites with datasets
### List of key concept:
• Pretrained NLP (Transformers Based Networks)

• Recurrent Network (Any RNN model LSTM, GRU)

• Rule Based Models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression,)

• Interpretability and Explainablity (LIME, SHAPP, Integrated Gradient(IG) )

• Autoencoder
You can search papers with codes and do literature review. Also, you can find data either in
Google data search or Kaggle competition website.

## Deliverables
The Group Proposal will be due 2 weeks after final project description is posted. For Group
Final Report and Group Presentation check the syllabus.

• Make a folder and name it Group-Proposal. Write your final group proposal in a word
document and save it as a PDF file. Place the group proposal in the Group-Proposal
Folder.

• Make a folder and name it Final-Group-Project-Report. Write your final group project
report in a word document and save it as a PDF file. Move it to the Final-Group-ProjectReport folder.

• Make a folder and name it Final-Group-Presentation. Create a powerpoint presentation
for your group presentation. Save the presentation as a PDF file and move it to the
Final-Group-Presentation folder.

• Make a new folder and name it Code. Save all of your codes for the final project in it.
For example, if you write code for multiple parts of the project, name them properly and
write a README file for it. This README file should explain what order codes need to
be run in (e.g., codes to fetch data should be run first, then code to preprocess, and then
modeling, etc.) and a short description of what each script does.

• Have one group member create a GitHub repository for the project and name it FinalProject-GroupX where X is your group number (The rest of the group members can be
added in as collaborators and fork it, so you only need one repo for the project). Then,
push the 4 folders that we discussed above into the repository that you created. You should
have a markdown file (README.md) that explains the structure of the repoistory and how it
works. Make it as clear as possible.
