    "# Notebook Description\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Similar to the generic notebook, this script augments the math problem dataset from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/classification-of-math-problems-by-kasut-academy/overview) Kaggle competition to address class imbalance, aiming for a target number of samples per class (e.g., 3000). It only exposes the first 9189 rows of the original training data as the basis for augmentation so that remaining samples can be used for validation.\n",
    "- **Methodology**: It employs AWS Bedrock with claud 3.5 sonnet for generation.\n",
    "- **Generation Strategy**: The core strategy involves providing the model with an example problem from the target topic and prompting it to generate a batch of new, similar problems. The prompt specifically instructs the model to match the mathematical complexity and style, use varied contexts/phrasing, and importantly, to include LaTeX or math symbols if they were present in the original example problem. Generated problems are requested in a delimited list format.\n",
    "- **Key Difference with the Generic Notebook**: This code adds specific instruction about LaTeX/math symbols to ensure the generated synthetic data more closely mirrors the style and formatting of the original math problems. Since mathematical notation is crucial for problem understanding and structure, forcing the model to replicate this aspect aims to create higher-quality, more realistic augmented data. Also the previous notebook exposes all the original training data in the prompts for some classes, this version only uses the first 9189 samples so that remaining 1000 samples are untouched.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Leverages parallel processing via ThreadPoolExecutor to speed up the generation for different topics and batches. Includes error handling for Bedrock API calls, such as throttling, with retry logic.\n",
    "Output: The augmented data (generated questions and labels) is compiled into a DataFrame and saved as a CSV file (named augmented_train_second_attempt.csv in the notebook's example run)."
