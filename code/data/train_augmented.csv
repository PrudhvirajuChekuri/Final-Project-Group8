"Solve the system of equations using matrix methods: 2x + y - z = 4, x - y + 2z = 5, and 3x + 2y + z = 7. What is the solution? (A) x = 2, y = 1, z = 1 (B) x = 1, y = 2, z = 3 (C) No solution exists (D) Infinitely many solutions (E) x = 3, y = -1, z = 2",6
"An online survey system assigns respondents to one of three groups: A, B, or C. The probability of being assigned to group A is 0.4, to group B is 0.35, and to group C is 0.25. If a respondent is in group A, there's a 70% chance they will complete the survey. For group B, it's 60%, and for group C, it's 50%. Given that a randomly selected respondent completed the survey, what is the probability they were in group A?",3
