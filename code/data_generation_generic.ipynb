    "# Notebook Description\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: This notebook aims to augment the math problem dataset from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/classification-of-math-problems-by-kasut-academy/overview) Kaggle competition by generating synthetic data, particularly for classes with fewer samples, to achieve a more balanced class distribution (targeting 3000 samples per class).\n",
    "- **Methodology**: It utilizes AWS Bedrock, specifically the anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet model for generation.\n",
    "- **Generation Strategy**: For each underrepresented topic, it takes example problems from the original dataset within that topic. It prompts the Bedrock model to generate a batch of new math problems inspired by the example, matching the topic and complexity but using varied contexts and phrasing. The prompt instructs the model to return a list of problems separated by a specific delimiter (\\n---\\n) for easier parsing.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: The generation process is parallelized using Python's ThreadPoolExecutor for efficiency. It includes error handling for potential Bedrock API issues like throttling, incorporating retries with exponential backoff.\n",
    "Output: The newly generated questions and their corresponding labels are combined into a pandas DataFrame and saved as CSV."
